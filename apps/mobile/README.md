# Mobile

This is the mobile application for the InfocusApp application. It is built with React Native and Expo.

## Getting Started

To get started with the mobile application, you first need to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start the Expo development server. You can then run the application on an Android or iOS simulator, or on a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## Building

To build the application for production, you can refer to the Expo documentation for building standalone apps.
